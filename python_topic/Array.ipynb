    "#### Lists\n",
    "In Python List are the most flexible and commonly used data structure for sequential storage. They are similar to arrays in other languages but with several key differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> Dynamic Typing:</b> Python lists can hold elements of different types in the same list. We can have an integer, a string and even other lists all stored within a single list.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> Dynamic Resizing:</b> Lists are dynamically resized, meaning you can add or remove elements without declaring the size of the list upfront.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> Built-in Methods: </b> Python lists come with numerous built-in methods that allow for easy manipulation of the elements within them, including methods for appending, removing, sorting and reversing elements."
